name: FedoraIoT
class: center, middle, bg-dark, fg-light

# Fedora IoT

focused on being a strong foundation for IoT ecosystems

[Project Page](https://iot.fedoraproject.org)

---

## Fedora IoT

Fedora IoT is a specialized Fedora Distribution for IoT Devices and
Edge Comuting.

-   immutable OS Image (ostree)
-   snapshots, rollbacks
-   working on aarch64, Raspberry Pi 3 Model B(+)
-   also working x86 VMs
-   IoT related Software pre-installed
-   Security Software pre-installed
-   layered packages (like cockpit)

???

-   explain rpm-ostree

name: k3s
class: center, middle, bg-dark, fg-light

# Kubernetes (k3s)

Lightweight Kubernetes

[Project Page](https.//k3s.io)

---

## k3s

Lightweight Kubernetes. Easy to install, half the memory, all in a binary less than 40mb.

**k8s, 5 changes = k3s**

-   removed legacy, non-default, experimental
-   removed in-tree plugins (cloud + storage)
-   sqlite as default storage, but etcd available
-   simple launcher
-   minimal to no dependencies (aside kernel and cgroups)

---
name: Ansible
class: center, middle, bg-dark, fg-light

# Ansible

simple, agentless IT Automation

[Project Page](https://www.ansible.com)

---

## Ansible

I am already using Ansible for:

-   setting a hostname
-   installing some layered packages
-   configuring services
-   configuring firewall
-   configuring podman (just because it's awesome)

???

- because of laziness
- so it was natural to "next slide"

---

## Ansible

So, it was natural to:

- create namespaces
- deploy applications
- manage services
- manage ingress

???

- basically, you can apply every kubernetes file
- kubernetes files can be created from podman

# Demo Time
